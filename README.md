# Credit Risk Analytics

When a bank gives a loan to a bad customer who is infact a good customer,results in greater loss to the bank rather than 
denying a loan to a good customer.
So,it would be helpful to identify the characteristics that are indicative of people who are likely to default on loans,
and then use those characteristics to discriminate between good and bad credit risks

The main aim of this project is to predict if a customer will default on loan or not.
Used
1.Logistic regression 
2.Decision tree algorithms to build the model.

Among the two algorithms Logistic Regression gave the best accuracy of 72.8%
