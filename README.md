# Loan-Default-Prediction

When a bank gives a loan to a bad customer who is infact a good customer,results in greater loss to the bank rather than 
denying a loan to a good customer.
So,it would be helpful to identify the characteristics that are indicative of people who are likely to default on loans,
and then use those characteristics to discriminate between good and bad credit risks

The main aim of this project is to predict if a customer will default on loan or not.Used Logistic regression to build the model
Also attached the WOE table generated for the categorical variables in the data
